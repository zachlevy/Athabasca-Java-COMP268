Grade: 100.00 / 100.00
Hi Zachary,

Thank you for the work. The profile meets the requirement of the assignment in term of number of items. However I found the reflection is too brief for the readers to understand the substance of the reflection. For example in Assignment 2 Question 25, what exactly are the trouble in controlling the multiple inputs, and what are the mixture of codes? But in turn any judgement on reflective article is qualitative and subject to debate. In any case you are on the right track. Good work!

Any question please feel free to email me.
